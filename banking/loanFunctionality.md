Certainly! Let's define the functionality for adding a loan service to your smart contract as an assignment. This will guide you on how to implement it in your code:

**Assignment: Implement a Loan Service in the Banking Smart Contract**

**Objective:**
Extend the existing `Banking` smart contract to include a basic loan service, allowing users to request loans and repay them with interest.

**Tasks:**

1. **Add Loan Data Structure:**
   - Define a new data structure called `Loan` to store loan information. It should include fields for the loan amount, annual interest rate, loan duration, and the timestamp when the loan was initiated.

2. **Add Loan Mapping:**
   - Create a mapping that associates each user's address with their loan details (i.e., `mapping(address => Loan) loans`).

3. **Request Loan Function:**
   - Implement a function named `requestLoan` that allows users to request a loan.
   - Check that the loan amount is greater than zero.
   - Ensure that a user doesn't already have an active loan.
   - Calculate the total repayment amount, which includes the principal and interest based on the specified interest rate and loan duration.
   - Verify that the user has sufficient funds in their balance to cover the total repayment.
   - If the conditions are met, store the loan details in the `loans` mapping for the user.

4. **Repay Loan Function:**
   - Implement a function named `repayLoan` for users to repay their loans.
   - Check if the user has an active loan.
   - Ensure that the loan is due for repayment (based on the loan duration).
   - Calculate the total repayment amount, considering the principal and interest.
   - Verify that the user has enough funds in their balance to cover the repayment.
   - Deduct the total repayment amount from the user's balance and mark the loan as repaid by setting the loan amount to zero.

5. **Loan Status Check Function:**
   - Create a function named `getLoanStatus` that allows users to check the status of their active loan.
   - This function should return the loan amount, interest rate, duration, and timestamp for the user's loan.

**Additional Considerations:**
- Ensure the contract owner and user-specific permissions for loan operations.
- Implement proper security measures to protect against potential vulnerabilities.
- Test the contract thoroughly to validate its functionality.

**Notes:**
- The provided code in the previous response serves as a reference for implementing these tasks.
- Customize the contract to meet your specific requirements and security considerations.

This assignment outlines the steps needed to integrate a loan service into your existing `Banking` smart contract. Implementing this functionality will require you to update your contract code according to the provided instructions.
