You can add various functionalities to your banking contract to make it more versatile and useful. Here are some additional features you can consider implementing:

1. **Interest Rate**: Implement an interest rate mechanism where users can earn interest on their deposited funds over time.

2. **Time-Locked Savings**: Allow users to lock their funds for a specific period during which they cannot withdraw. This can be useful for savings accounts with maturity dates.

3. **Multi-Signature Ownership**: Allow multiple addresses to jointly own the contract. Implement a multi-signature mechanism for important actions such as changing ownership.

4. **Transaction History**: Keep a log of all transactions, including deposits, withdrawals, transfers, and changes in ownership.

5. **Limit Withdrawals**: Set a limit on the maximum amount a user can withdraw at a time or within a specified period.

6. **Notify Users**: Implement a notification system to notify users of their balance changes or other important events.

7. **Support Multiple Currencies**: Allow users to deposit and transact with different tokens or cryptocurrencies, not just Ether.

8. **Overdraft Protection**: Prevent users from overdrawing their accounts by implementing checks to ensure that they have sufficient funds before allowing withdrawals.

9. **Security Features**: Implement additional security measures, such as two-factor authentication for sensitive operations or withdrawal confirmation mechanisms.

10. **Emergency Freeze**: Allow the owner to freeze the contract temporarily in case of a security breach or other emergencies.

11. **Beneficiary Designation**: Allow users to specify beneficiaries who will inherit their funds in case of their demise.

12. **Account Locking**: Give users the ability to lock their accounts for a specific duration, during which no withdrawals or transfers are allowed.

13. **Gas Price Monitoring**: Monitor gas prices and adjust the contract's behavior to optimize transaction costs during periods of high gas fees.

14. **Custom Access Permissions**: Implement a more granular access control system, allowing different roles (e.g., admin, user) with different permissions.

15. **Smart Contract Interactions**: Allow users to interact with other smart contracts or DeFi protocols directly from their accounts.

16. **Regular Withdrawals**: Implement a feature for users to set up recurring withdrawals or transfers to other accounts.

17. **Secure Password Recovery**: Enable users to set up secure methods for password recovery in case they lose their private keys.

18. **Custom Tokens**: Allow users to create their own custom tokens within the contract, which can represent unique assets.

Remember that when adding these functionalities, you must carefully design and test them to ensure the security and integrity of the contract. Additionally, consider the gas costs associated with each operation, especially if you're working with a limited gas budget.
